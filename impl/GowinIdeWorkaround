1. This is used to run the IDE on Ubuntu 24:

> QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION=none LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so.6 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=gowin_1.9.12/IDE/lib/ ./gw_ide

2. "Bank 6 vccio(3.3)" error
```
ERROR  (CT1136) : Bank 6 vccio(3.3) is locked by other constraint or embedded port, conflicting BANK_VCCIO set by 'clk_i_ibuf' : IO_TYPE = LVCMOS18 in the same bank

```
To mitigate it, manually edit constraints file, e.g. like so:
```
IO_LOC "clk_i" 10;
IO_PORT "clk_i" IO_TYPE=LVCMOS33 PULL_MODE=UP BANK_VCCIO=3.3;
```
Something is broke in newer IDE (or was old IDE less restrictive)?
The point is that BANK6 needs to be under 3.3VCC so `IO_TYPE` needs to be set to `LVCMOS33`.
Old IDE didn't care about it.
